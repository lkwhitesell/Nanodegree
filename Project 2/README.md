# Memory Game Project

## How the Game Works
The goal of this game is to turn over pairs of matching cards until there are no more remaining cards. You will start with 16 cards, all lying face down. A usual player turn will look like the following:

* Select one card to reveal its underlying symbol
* Select a second card to attempt to find the card with a matching symbol
* If the two cards selected match, both will stay flipped over
* If the two cards do not match, both cards will be flipped face down

Repeat the above steps until all the cards are flipped over!
