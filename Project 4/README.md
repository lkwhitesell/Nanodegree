# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Included in the project is the testing framework, [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and a simple test suite. This test suite will be ran automatically when the application is launched and the results will be visible at the bottom of the page.

# How to Run

To get the application running on your machine, you will need to download or clone the project from the repository.

The repository contains several projects. To access the Feed Reader application, open the Project 4 folder. Within the Project 4 folder are css, js, font, and jasmine folders, as well as an index.html and a README.md file. The only file that you need to worry about is the index.html file. To open the application, all you need to do is open the index.html file in a web browser.
