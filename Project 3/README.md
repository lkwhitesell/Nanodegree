## How to Run

To get the game running on your machine, you will need to download or clone the project from the repository.

The repository contains several projects. To access the arcade game, open the **Project 3** folder. Within the **Project 3** folder are css, images, and js folders, as well as an index.html and a README.md file. The only file that you need to worry about is the **index.html** file. To open the game, all you need to do is open the **index.html** file in a web browser. 

Now you are ready to play!

## How to Play

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

- The player can move left, right, up and down
- The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
- Once a the player collides with an enemy, the score is reduced and the player moves back to the starting square
- Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the score is increased and the player moves back to the starting square
- At any time, the player can reset the game where the score will be reset and the player will be moved back to the starting square
